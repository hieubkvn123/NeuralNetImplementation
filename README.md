# NeuralNetImplementation
Simple Neural network implementation in Java (No Framework)\
This is a very simple implementation of neural network in Java (with only one Input layer and one Output layer)\
The purpose of this project is to understand how optimization algorithms like SGD, ADAM, RMSProp, ... works\
The project is still under making, will be further enhanced to have hidden layers, dropout layers, activations, ...\
